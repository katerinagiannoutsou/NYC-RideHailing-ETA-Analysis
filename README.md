# NYC-RideHailing-ETA-Analysis
This repository analyzes the relationship between driver availability and estimated arrival times (ETAs) in NYC’s ride-hailing market. Using real-world data, it tests theoretical delay models, examines neighborhood variations, and provides insights to optimize service efficiency and urban mobility.

This code is part of the second chapter of my Ph.D. thesis, "Data-Driven Analysis of Driver Availability and Rider Delays: Insights from Ride-Hailing Data in the New York Metropolitan Area".
Utilizing a comprehensive dataset encompassing multiple years of ride-hailing activity within the New York metropolitan area, coupled with geospatial data, this analysis aims to validate the relationship between rider delays (estimated time of arrival, or ETA) and the availability of drivers in specific locations. 

This study seeks to ascertain whether the functional relationship observed in real-world data mirrors the theoretical models commonly referenced in existing ride-hailing literature. Additionally, considering the diverse spatial characteristics of New York’s neighborhoods, this study explores variations in the dependency of delays on driver availability, investigating the extent to which these relationships align with spatial delay theory or diverge towards patterns more indicative of congestion-related delays. 

This inquiry further investigates how spatial dynamics influence the performance outcomes for ride-hailing platforms. 

This study is critical as it not only seeks to bridge theoretical assumptions with empirical findings in the context of urban mobility, but also contributes to the optimization of ride-hailing operations, ultimately enhancing service efficiency and consumer satisfaction in metropolitan transport networks.
